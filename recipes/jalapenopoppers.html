    <h1>Jalapeno Poppers</h1>

        <p>Sharp Cheddar cheese is the rich, delicious filling for these spicy favorites! They are baked rather than deep fried. You'll want to pop them down one after another!</p>
        <p>Jalapeno Poppers are my obsession! Fresh Jalapenos are sliced in half and filled with a rich creamy cheese filling and topped with a crisp Panko topping. These poppers are baked until golden and bubbly for the perfect game day snack</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>

            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon milk</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups crushed corn flake cereal</li>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking sheet.</li>

            <li>Arrange in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven 30 minutes, or until filling is bubbly and lightly browned.</li>
